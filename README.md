## Summary

* A Blockchain is a chain of blocks.
* It uses cryptography to ensure data integrity.
* You can open and run the sample code in Visual Studio 2017.
* Proof-of-Work requires a significant amount of computing time to generate new blocks.
* By slowing down the new block generating process and average out the block adding time in a Blockchain network, tampering with a blockchain becomes virtually impossible.
* Attackers need a lot of computer power to tamper with a blockchain because they need to update all blocks in the chain after the tampered block and catch up with newly added blocks.
* This is very difficult because new blocks are constantly added into the blockchain by good players.
* Proof-of-Work requires a lot of computing time.
* This brings up a question, why are people willing to connect their computer to a blockchain network and donate their computing time to the mining process?
