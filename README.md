## Summary

* A Blockchain is a chain of blocks.
* It uses cryptography to ensure data integrity.
* You can open and run the sample code in Visual Studio 2017.
* Proof-of-Work requires a significant amount of computing time to generate new blocks.
* By slowing down the new block generating process and average out the block adding time in a Blockchain network, tampering with a blockchain becomes virtually impossible.
* Attackers need a lot of computer power to tamper with a blockchain because they need to update all blocks in the chain after the tampered block and catch up with newly added blocks.
* This is very difficult because new blocks are constantly added into the blockchain by good players.
* Proof-of-Work requires a lot of computing time.
* This brings up a question, why are people willing to connect their computer to a blockchain network and donate their computing time to the mining process?
* I did further refactor and add transaction and reward into the basic blockchain.
* We have a more completed Blockchain right now.
* However, everything we have so far works only on one computer.
* The blockchain is a decentralized, distributed network.
* How to build a network and let computers join the network as a node and talk to each other.
* It will be the next thing I want to cover in my next article.

## Award

* The incentive for miners to continue providing their computing time to generate new blocks is awarded. Awards are given after processed transactions and adding a new block.

Thanks goes out to Henry He for the FREE stuff!
